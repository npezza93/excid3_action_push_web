# Action Push Web

Action Push Web is a Rails web push notification gem for PWAs using the [Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API).

## Installation

```bash
bundle add action_push_web
bin/rails action_push_web:install:migrations
bin/rails db:migrate
bin/rails g action_push_web:install
```

## Configuration

To load VAPID details from ENV or Rails credentials, use ERB in `config/push.yml`.

```yaml
# config/push.yml
shared:
  web:
    vapid:
      subject: <%= ENV["VAPID_SUBJECT"] || Rails.application.credentials.dig(:vapid, :subject) %>
      public_key: <%= ENV["VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY"] || Rails.application.credentials.dig(:vapid, :public_key) %>
      private_key: <%= ENV["VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY"] || Rails.application.credentials.dig(:vapid, :private_key) %>
```

## How It Works

Web Push notifications require the following setup:

1. Register service worker triggered by user gesture (like clicking a button).
2. Request Notification permission from browser
3. Once granted, [subscribe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushManager/subscribe) to the push service using service worker registration
4. Store [PushSubscription](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushSubscription) in backend database
5. Backend sends notification using PushSubscription endpoint
6. Service worker receives [`push`]() event and shows Notification

## JavaScript

Using the generated Stimulus controller for Notifications, we can add a button that attempts to subscribe to Web Push.

```erb
<%= tag.button "Notifications", data: {
  controller: :notifications,
  action: "notifications#attemptToSubscribe",
  notifications_subscriptions_url_value: push_subscriptions_path,
  notifications_vapid_public_key_value: ActionPushWeb.vapid_identification.fetch(:public_key)
} %>
```

When clicked, this will register the service worker, ask for Notification permission, and make a POST request to `push_subscriptions_path` to store the `PushSubscription` details with Action Push Web.

### Service Worker

The service worker is responsible for receiving Push events and displaying them with the [Notification API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API).

It can be used to set the the app badge as well.

## Sending Notifications

You can send notifications to one subscription or many using the pool.

Common arguments for notifications:

- `title` - The title of the notification
- `body` - The main content of the notification
- `path` - A path like `/notifications` to open when the notification is clicked
- `badge` (optional) - Sets the badge on the icon, commonly used for unread message counts
- `icon` (optional) - URL of an icon to be displayed in the notification

See [Notification parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notification/Notification)

### Sending to a single subscription

Using an `ActionPushWeb::Subscription`, you can build a notification and deliver it.

```ruby
push_subscription = Current.user.push_subscriptions.last
push_subscription.notification(
  title: "Hello world",
  body: Random.uuid,
  path: notifications_path,
  badge: 1,
  icon: image_url("logo.png")
).deliver
```

### Sending to many subscriptions

You can send many notifications at once using the Pool. This uses a persistent connection to speed up delivery.

```ruby
push_subscriptions = ActionPushWeb::Subscription.all

ActionPushWeb.queue({
  title: "Hello world",
  body: Random.uuid,
  path: notifications_path,
  badge: 1,
  icon: image_url("logo.png")
}, push_subscriptions)
```

## Frontend

On the frontend, there are 3 custom HTML elements that can be accessed via helpers.

The first is when the user has not yet granted permission to send notifications.

You can use what ever HTML you want inside these components. Once the user either grants or denies
permission the component will hide itself.

```erb
<%= ask_for_web_notifications do %>
  <div class="text-blue">Request permission</div>
<% end %>
```

If a user denies permission to send notifications:

```erb
<%= when_web_notifications_disabled do %>
  <div class="text-red">Notifications aren’t allowed</div>
<% end %>
```

And if a user grants permission to send notifications,
it accepts an `href` attribute to be passed to the helper that points to a create
action that handles creating a push subscription. By default it points to, `push_subscriptions_path`. It
also accepts a `service_worker_url` attribute that points to the service worker.
By default it points to `pwa_service_worker_path(format: :js)`

```erb
<%= when_web_notifications_allowed class: "text-green" do %>
  Notifications are allowed
<% end %>
```

You can alternatively create a custom controller that handles creating a push subscription:

```ruby
class CustomPushSubscriptionsController < ActionPushWeb::SubscriptionsController
  private
    def push_subscription_params
      super.merge(owner: Current.user)
    end
end
```

```erb
<%= ask_for_web_notifications(href: custom_push_subscriptions_path) do %>
  <div class="text-blue">Request permission</div>
<% end %>
```

## Debugging
Ensure that your operating system settings allow notifications for your browser.
